If you want standing desks that will be used by your employees go ahead and drop us a line. Take 2 minutes to fill out our <a href="/quiz/">sitting questionaire</a> to see how much you sit and what is important. <br><br> We also offer tests of standing desk solutions so that we can find out if you company is ready for implementation. This way no major investments have to be done upfront.'

              The Jaswig TestCube created a flexible and beautiful place to strech our legs and work upright from time to time. People did all sorts of things at the desks. They were truly multifunctional!

              We conducted a survey from our staff during the test. It was so interesting to see how people had perceived this test. They really liked the product. They valued its flexibility and loved to use it from time to time.
