content-inner: Working from home has a lot of upsides. We devoted an entire blogpost to the subject <a href="/blog/2017/03/22/ergonomicsathome.html">you can find here</a>. Be sure to check it out if you are a home worker.<br><br> But working from home also means that you are the office manager. You have to decide where and how to work. In the office on the other hand HR managers, prevention advisors and facility managers take care of this. <br><br>By introducing a Jaswig standing desk at home you create the perfect working environment that allows you to work more dynamically.<br><br> It is small, looks nice (we won several design awards) and has an ergonomic footrest which is of great importance for your back (<a href="/blog/2016/05/25/FAQs.html">check the ergonomics section of our FAQ blogpost</a>)
