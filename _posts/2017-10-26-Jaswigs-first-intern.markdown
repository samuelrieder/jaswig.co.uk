We are very happy to announce Kevin (the Kev, La Kevs) joined our team. We have been looking for an intern for quite a while and saw a lot of potential interns but the Kev had it all (although he is quite a slow, he is from Limburg you know…)

## So tell us Kevin what do you do at our company?

I’m a design student so probably I'm going to try and design some stuff, I guess that is why I’m here, no :)?  My first ideas are some add on products for the Nomad. Next to that I try to beat Henri in eating the epic Jaswig Croque monsieur, but still hard to beat the master.

## Tell our readers a little more about the atmosphere here at Jaswig?

I feel that these guys have a rather nice balance between work and play focus and distraction. We need standup once in a while when working but we also need to have fun from time to time.

## What are you going to miss most after your internship?

My DIY desk with the COOPER standing desk converter on it! And the overview I have on all of you guys. It is rather pleasant to see the interactions in between the four of you on a day to day basis. The discussions, the happy moments and the more difficult moments.
