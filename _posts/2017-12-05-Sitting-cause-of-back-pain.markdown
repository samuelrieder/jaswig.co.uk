Back pain is a major problem for a lot of people. Sitting a lot and moving too little is one of the causes of pain. Moving more is the solution.

## What

A lot of people suffer from back and neck pain. The pain can have numerous causes. It speaks for itself that the goal of this article is not to go over all of them. In this article we would like to focus on a cause that is quite common though: back pain caused by prolonged sitting at our desks.

## Why does it strain your back

Sitting exerts large pressure on the intervertebral disk. When this pressure is applied for too long the discs become weak and kindle. The amount of pressure on the disc is a function of how you sit. Why people sit in a bad position can have several reasons:

* it is very hard to maintain the right posture for a long period
* people don’t often know what a good sitting posture is
* they don’t have the furniture that helps them to achieve a good posture
* and even if you could attain that posture it is still not healthy to be in the same position for long

As seen on the picture above, standing upright exert less pressure on the discs as sitting which proofs the main point of the article. People should stand, sit, lay down and change positions throughout the day as often as possible. This causes the pressure on the discs to vary as much as possible and activates the big muscle groups in the body which in turn take away pressure from the discs.

Activating these big muscles groups have an additional advantage. Moving more increases blood circulations which results in better supply of oxygen which is good for our state-of-mind!

## Conclusion

Our bodies are not made to do something (whatever it is) for too long at a time. Our bodies are “made” to switch positions and to move around.

The rule of thumb is:

**“The best position is always the next position!”**
