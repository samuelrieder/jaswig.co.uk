Go for ergonomic furniture.
When new trends and ergonomics meet, it is sure to make people more flexible and less deskbound. They follow a nomadic style of working which enables their body to change position. Our bodies function best when we keep changing positions. It keeps our blood flow active and makes sure that our important fat transforming processes work properly.
