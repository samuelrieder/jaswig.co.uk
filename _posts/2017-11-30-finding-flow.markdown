What exactly is flow? How can it make our lives more fulfilling and how can we start experiencing it more often?

## Discoveries

There are certain activities you can do to increase your happiness. Some things of course have larger chance of success than others. The psychologist Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi, who co founded the positive psychology movement, did extensive research on this topic. We are going to discuss a few of his findings.


**There are two types of enjoyments**
* Bodily pleasure (eating, sex, etc)
* Flow/gratifications

You’ve probably experienced it already but bodily pleasures are the type of pleasure that can’t last forever. We feel good while eating or having sex but the pleasure is confined to a certain period of time. Exaggerating with bodily pleasures can even trigger disgust like eating too much for example.

But Csikszentmihalyi discovered there was another type of enjoyment, and he called it flow. Flow is the feeling one has if he is completely immersed in a specific task. The tasks that typically trigger this feeling are challenging and very closely linked to one's abilities/strengths. Flow is also triggered easily while engaging in challenging physical efforts like skiing, climbing, diving, running etc. Next to that, flow is aided by music or action with other people such as playing team sports.

## Important aspects

So, like we've discussed already to enter a state of flow there most be a clear challenge that fully engages our attention and we have to have the skillset to meet the challenge at hand. Another important factor is immediate feedback on how good or bad we are doing.

## Pleasures

Pleasures are sensory in nature. To be able to have a positive impact on your happiness it is better to spread the pleasures over time as otherwise they lose their impact and disgust pears around the corner.

## Flow/gratifications

Gratifications on the other hand lead to flow, they come from accomplishing something, learning something, or improving something. One of the best tips to reside more often in a state of flow is to know your strengths and do things that require these specific characteristics/demands. If you want to know what your strengths so that you can pick the right "battle" take [“the strengths test”](https://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/testcenter)!
