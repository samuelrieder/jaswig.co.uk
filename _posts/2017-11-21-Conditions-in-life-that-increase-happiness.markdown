Happiness has been studied extensively over the centuries. And philosophers, psychologists and neuroscientists are making nice progress.

## The happiness formula

H = S + C + V

H = Happiness
S = Set point, the biological/genetical point around which you naturally reside in terms of happiness
C = conditions of your life
V = voluntary activities

Today we are going to zoom in on C, the 5 conditions of your life that can have a large impact on your direct happiness. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that quite a lot of factors also are very relevant for working environments.

## Noise

Variable or intermittent noise can have a profound and direct impact on your happiness. This kind of noise increases stress indicators in you blood. So it is really worthwhile reducing. For example, by introducing moment of quietness in your life or invest in a good noise cancelling headphone for at the office. http://www.techradar.com/news/audio/portable-audio/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-1280490

## Commuting

Many people move away from their working places or start working quite far away from where they live. There can be several reasons for this, because cities are expensive places to live or because people just want a bigger house or because there is not enough work where they live. But guess what, you tend to adapt rapidly to your larger mansion while you won’t adapt to the longer commuting times. So if you suffer from increased levels of stress a first step to reduce them could be to move closer to where you work or switch jobs of course!

## Lack of control

You know it already at this stage but, things that we don’t control stress us out. People that have a sense of control perform better, are happier and more at ease. Changing a company's environment to increase the sense of control among workers is a really effective way to increase their sense of engagement, energy and happiness. Let them choose where to sit, let them choose what furniture they want, let them choose when to work (if possible). Give them a sense of belonging and control.

## Shame

Shame has a profound impact on our daily lives. It might sound really strange but adjusting things you are really ashamed of can have profound impacts on your happiness. You can of course also try to cope with what you are ashamed of by acknowledging it and engage in meditation or cognitive therapy. 

## Relationships

We finish with the condition that has the largest influence on our happiness! Namely, the strength and number of a person’s relationships. For example, having chronic conflict with someone close to you is one of the surest ways to reduce your happiness. It seems that our brains never really adapt to interpersonal conflict. It damages you every single day, it is that simple. So if you wanna change something profound in your life try to solve such an issue in the coming weeks!
