So don’t feel bad if you have a problem sitting for a long time.There is a great solution that can help you out- ‘Standing desks’! 
There are a lot of options available in the market and some might fit your need better than the others. So without waiting any further, 
let’s check out the options available.

## 5 DIY Standing Desk

Though this option isn’t for everyone; if you have the time and skill required to build this desk, this could be your perfect solution.
There is a lot of information available on the internet but we found a great article about the different DIY options by Lifehacker. 
You can check out the article [here.](https://lifehacker.com/5929765/make-yourself-a-standing-desk-this-weekend)
  
Even if there are numerous options available, our preferred option is buying an electric frame and mounting it on your own customized top.
This option enables you to work with different materials of different shapes and sizes while still having a stable and adjustable desk.

## 4 Electric Standing Desk

Electric standing desks are a great choice, but they take up space. 
Additionally, they are a little costly and might set you back by a few 100 euros. 
Other than that, an Electric standing desk is the easiest option, from sitting to standing, with just one simple push of a button.
If you have an existing desk, you must replace it with this one. Not only will it exactly do the same task of offering space and 
stability but it will only do it a lot better than your older desk. Despite the fact that the necessary electric cable will make it 
less mobile, it won’t bother you since you can’t lift that baby alone ;-)
 
To sum it up, we have listed the pros and cons of using an Electric standing desk: 
\+ big desk\
\+ great for office and home use
\+ easily adjustable
\+ customizable
\+ stable
\- more expensive
\- needs a cable
\- replaces old desk
