We have big news, we are setting up a thorough partnership with Fully! New standing desk, balance board, standing mats and more...
<!--more-->


## Who, What and Why

[Fully](https://www.fully.com/about-us) is an American [B-Corporation](https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/about-b-lab) based in Portland Oregon with a vision, similar to ours (to say the least):

“The idea behind Fully is simple: Movement is good. When you move, when you are fully in your body, you feel more present, engaged, and alive. More of you show up to work, to relationships, to life.”

Mathias, co-founder and head of operations in the United States [(www.jaswig.com)](http://www.jaswig.com/) reached out to Fully a few months back. Mathias, who had just moved back from the US to Belgium, was looking for a strong partnership to run the online business of Jaswig in the US.

He reached out to a few companies and had several very interesting interviews but the conversations with David Kahl, the CEO and founder of Fully were different. They were inspiring and felt very natural.
In these conversations David also shared that spreading to Europe could be interesting for his business.

In May of 2017 David came to Ghent to meet the Jaswig team (Mathias, Sam, Nick, Henri, John and Daphne) as we had a lot to talk about!

We had very thorough and interesting discussions about our team, products, profits, vision and personal relations with the company. He went back to the States with the plan to work out a collaboration agreement with his legal and financial team.

## Fast-forward three months

Fully will take over the US operations and Jaswig Europe has broadened its product portfolio with the top products from Fully. Next to this, Fully will further assist Jaswig in its goal to get people standing and moving during work. Their 15 years of experience in the furniture market will play a crucial role.

## Products

Until now, Jaswig has developed two commercial products, [the StandUp](http://www.jaswig.be/standup/) and the [MeetUp](http://www.jaswig.be/meetup/). And we’re working hard on our third one, [the SeatUp](http://www.jaswig.be/seatup/).

But, customers asked for more products. They “demanded” a wider portfolio, and that’s why we joined forces with Fully, as their product portfolio is consists out an extensive array of high quality designs.

Products we are launching that'll hopefully cover the demand of our customers are:

+ The best electric standing desk according to [WireCutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-standing-desk/) called [Jarvis](http://www.jaswig.be/jarvis/)
+ A standing desk converter called [Cooper](http://www.jaswig.be/Cooper/)
+ A [Tic Toc chair](http://www.jaswig.be/tic-toc/) and [balance board](http://www.jaswig.be/tic-toc-balance-board/)
+ [Topo standing mat](http://www.jaswig.be/topo-anti-fatigue-mat/)
+ other exciting accessories

## Pricing

Fully plays in another league when it comes to volume and turnover. Because of the fact that we are now teaming up with them we can also shift gears in terms of manufacturing conditions. This means that production prices will drop significantly. This price drop will reflect in our selling prices, of course!

This will make us more competitive in the higher volume market so that we can impact more people’s lives, which is the reason why we are in business.

The StandUp is the first product that will be significantly changed in price. Our new price will be: €350.


## Production

In the past couple of months we have been thinking hard about our supply chain. We had several discussions with David about this as well. Fully works together with manufacturers worldwide. Jaswig on the other hand currently manufactures some of its products in Belgium and some in Slovenia.

We’re currently really happy with the quality of our products but feel that ramping up the volume at our current suppliers could have a negative impact on quality and lead-time.

David explained to us how he approaches the Fully supply chain. For him it is of major importance to work with good factories that produce great quality at a competitive price at high volumes. He visits every factory he works with multiple times and extensively meets with the management team. In other words he really does his due diligence. During that due diligence, being a B-corp, sustainability, social responsibility and quality are extremely important.

Now that we have access to Fully’s vast network of manufacturers, we have numerous production possibilities for the StandUp and MeetUp.

If you have any advice on this difficult decision be sure to let us know!

We’ll keep everyone in the loop via social media and this blog.
