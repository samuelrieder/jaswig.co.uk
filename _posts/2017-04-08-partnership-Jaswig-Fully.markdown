We have big news, we are partnering with Fully!
<!--more-->


## Who and what?

Fully is an American B-Corporation based in Portland Oregon with the exact same mission [https://www.fully.com/about-us](https://www.fully.com/about-us) as ours.

“The idea behind Fully is simple: Movement is good. When you move, when you are fully in your body, you feel more present, engaged, and alive. More of you shows up to work, to relationships, to life.”

Mathias, co-founder and head of operations in the United States [http://www.jaswig.com/](www.jaswig.com) reached out to Fully a few months back. Mathias, who had just moved back from the US to Belgium was looking for a strong partnership to run the online business of Jaswig in the US.
He reached out to a few companies and had several very interesting interviews but the conversations with David Kahl, the CEO and founder of Fully were different. They were inspiring and felt very natural.
In these conversations David had expressed his interest in expanding his business beyond the US, and into the Continent.

In May of 2017 David came to Ghent to meet the team (Mathias, Sam, Nick, Henri and John).
We had very thorough and interesting discussions about our team, products, profits, vision and personal relations with the company. He went back to the States with a plan to work out a thorough collaboration agreement with his legal and financial team.

Fast forward three months.
Fully will take over the US operations and Jaswig Europe has broadened its product portfolio with excellent products from Fully. Next to this, Fully will further assist Jaswig in its goal to get people standing and moving during work. Their 15 years of experience in the furniture market will play a crucial role.

## Products

By now we’ve developed two commercial products, the StandUp and the MeetUp. We’re working hard on our third addition, the SeatUp.
But we can’t keep up with the customers demand, that’s why we joined forces with Fully.
Their product portfolio is extensive with high quality designs.

We found exactly what we needed with Fully to fill in the demand gap of our customers!
* The best electric standing desk called Jarvis
* A standing desk converter called Cooper
* A Tic Toc chair and balance board
* other exciting accessories!

Go and take a look!

## Pricing

The furniture business is competitive. This doesn’t mean that a company has to participate in the deadly spiral (and its environmental consequences) of a price war but it does mean that we have to take into account economic reality. After all, the goal is to have impact and get people standing. Something that will not happen without a sustainable business.

Fully, being a successful brand has competitively priced their products and maintained the high quality along the way.
The product merger has led to a new price point of the StandUp, our core product.

From now on the product will be sold at the very competitive price of 325 euros including VAT.

## Production

In the past couple of months we have been thinking hard about our supply chain. We had several discussions with David about this as well. Fully manufactures in China. Jaswig on the other hand currently manufactures part of its products in Belgium and a part of them in Slovenia. We are currently really happy with the quality of our product but feel that ramping up the volume at our current suppliers could have a negative impact on quality and lead time.

David explained to us how he approaches the Fully supply chain. For him it is of major importance to work with good factories that produce great quality at a competitive price. He visits every factory he works with multiple times and extensively meets with the management team. In other words he really does his due diligence. During that due diligence, being a B-corp, sustainability, social responsibility and quality are extremely important.

We aren’t sure yet if China is a good option for the StandUp and MeetUp, but we’re looking closely at pros and cons.
If you have any advice on this difficult decision be sure to let us know!

We’ll keep everyone in the loop via social media and this blog.
