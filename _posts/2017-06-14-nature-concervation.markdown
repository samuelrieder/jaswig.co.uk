Like we’ve discussed already in [our previous blogpost "1% for the planet"](http://www.jaswig.be/blog/2017/02/28/1-procent-for-the-planet.html), Jaswig committed to giving away 1% of its revenues to [Natuurpunt](https://www.natuurpunt.be/).

## 1. Why Natuurpunt?
Natuurpunt is a local organization that supports a cause that is close to our heart: biodiversity. The value of biodiversity cannot be overstated. We believe everything is interconnected and we need healthy natural cycles to be able to live a good and fulfilling life. At least 40 per cent of the world’s economy and 80 per cent of the needs of the poor are derived from biological resources. In addition, the richer the diversity of life, the greater the opportunity for medical discoveries, economic development, and adaptive responses to such new challenges as climate change. And last but not least, Jaswig depends heavily on these natural systems and cycles as wood is our primary source of manufacturing material!

## 2. The Meeting
Three weeks ago we had a meeting with the people who steer the local Natuurpunt collective at the [Boembeke mill](https://www.natuurpunt.be/bezoekerscentrum/boembekemolen) in Brakel (in the heart of Flemish Ardens). The water mill near the Zwalm river was reconstructed by Natuurpunt to form a meeting point for cyclists and hikers where they can enjoy the regions local food and drinks.

## 3. What do they stand for
We talked about a lot of different things during our meeting but the most important part was the discussion about why they do what they do. The answer was straightfoward. They feel that nature has an innate value and thus feel its important to speak up for nature as it can't. We shouldn’t forget that next to the innate value nature has it also gives society a lot of services, like:

* connecting people
* production of 02
* mitigating flood risk
* providing sustenance for both man and animal
* providing drinking water
* sequestration of CO2
* providing us with tools and raw materials

All these are ecosystem services that are really important to us. Without a robust and healthy natural system these services would fall away; leaving us with a less fulfilling and more difficult and expensive life. 

It really is important that we don’t see this money as “given away” it is a true and good investment in the real sense of the word!

Come and join us in the [natural habitats Natuurpunt is concerving](https://www.natuurpunt.be/natuurgebied/zwalmvallei-vossenhol-kloosterbos-steenbergse-bossen-boterhoek-jansveld-jan-de-lichte). We would be very happy to take a walk together with you :).
