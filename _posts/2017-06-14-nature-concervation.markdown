Like we’ve discussed already in [our previous blogpost 1% for the planet](http://www.jaswig.be/blog/2017/02/28/1-procent-for-the-planet.html), Jaswig is committed to give away 1% of its revenue to Natuurpunt.

## 1. Why Natuurpunt?
Because it is a local organization that supports a cause that lies close to our heart: biodiversity! We highly value biodiversity because everything is intertwined and we need healthy natural cycles to be able to live a good and fulfilling life. Jaswig depends heavily on these natural systems and cycles as wood is where we make our products out of!

## 2. The Meeting
Three weeks ago we had a meeting with the people that steer the local Natuurpunt collective at the Boembeke mill in Brakel (the Flemish Ardens). The water mill near the Zwalm river was reconstructed by Natuurpunt to form a meeting point where cyclists and hikers who are enjoying the region can meet up and [enjoy locally made drinks and patisserie](https://www.natuurpunt.be/bezoekerscentrum/boembekemolen).

## 3. Content
We talked about a lot of different things during our meeting but the most important part was the discussion about why they do what they do. They feel that nature has an innate value and thus they feel its important to speak up for nature as otherwise it is all to rapidly forgotten about. We shouldn’t forget that next to the innate value nature has it also gives human society a lot of services; it:

* connects people
* mitigates flood risk
* provides us with food
* provides us with drinking water
* sequestrates CO2
* provides us with wood 

All these are ecosystem services that are really important for us to value. Without a robust and healthy natural system these services would fall away; leaving us humans with a less fulfilling and more difficult and expensive life. 

It really is important that we don’t see this money as “given away” it is a true and good investment in the real sense of the word!

Come and join us in the [parts of nature Natuurpunt tries to secure](https://www.natuurpunt.be/natuurgebied/zwalmvallei-vossenhol-kloosterbos-steenbergse-bossen-boterhoek-jansveld-jan-de-lichte). We are happy to take a walk together with you :).
