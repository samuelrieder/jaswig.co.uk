We are very glad to announce that we have set up manufacturing and a sales channel in Australia and thus sell our StandUp in Australia :).

## 1. How did it all start

From the moment we launched our kickstarter campaign we got a lot of questions from down under asking if we shipped to Australia. We weren't really focussed on this market and it just didn't seem smart to ship it half way around the world. We wanted to find a good partner and let him make our desks locally. We found that partner in CAP Furniture located near Brisbane, Australia.

## 2. About CAP Funiture

[CAP Furniture](https://capfurniture.com.au/) is a family owned business and leading manufacturer of early childhood and custom disability furniture in Australia with over 30 years of experience. There’s a difference between furniture that has been made for the masses and furniture that has been given the touch of a craftsperson.

The difference between furniture you buy elsewhere and our furniture is a guarantee of equal parts quality and artistry.

We strive to give our custom made Australian manufactured furniture that artisan feel so that you, the end customer, can tell the difference when you’re using it.

## 3. Our collaboration

We were contacted by Mark Higgins over 6 months ago with the request for a collaboration. We worked out an agreement togehter and did some prototyping. The process and collaboration was so smooth that we both wanted to go on with it and give it a try!

If you would like to have some more info about the collaboration please contact us on [sam@jaswig.eu](mailto:sam@jaswig.eu). If you have some question for our Australian partner please contact Mark at [sales@capfurniture.com.au](mailto:sales@capfurniture.com.au).
