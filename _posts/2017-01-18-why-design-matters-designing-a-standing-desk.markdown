Objects are designed to solve problems, to fulfill emotional and/or basic necessities.

*“Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.”* - Steve Jobs

## 1. Problem solving designs

Objects are designed to **solve problems**, to fulfill emotional needs and/or basic necessities.
Almost every object we know is designed with a function in mind. Most of these objects we take for granted, think of a doorknob, your radio and even the pen you’re using.
Good basic design often makes itself invisible. Do you know still you’re using a one ton machine to move yourself around?

There are of course countless examples of designs that are created to stand out.
Think of the [“chair” Picasso](https://www.moma.org/m/tours/41/tour_stops/555?locale=en) made, on which you can’t actually sit and thus serves a purely aesthetic function.

We started designing for several reasons:

+ Economics: if turns out to be a hit, we can do what we love for a living
+ Relationships: own and share a company with friends and get to know interesting people
+ Positive change: we want to leave something behind that serves a purpose

## 2. Our problem we wanted to solve

We came across the **huge problem** of [**excessive sitting**](http://www.jaswig.be/blog/2016/04/14/why-should-i-use-a-standing-desk.html), which causes pandemic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and even depression.
Although this is common knowledge in the scientific community, nobody succeeded in making people more dynamic at work or in class.
We want a **#standingrevolution** to happen by designing a product that is so versatile it can be used wherever you want, by everyone.

A question quickly arose: if you want everyone to use the product, why than don’t you offer it at the lowest price possible?

We found that designing a product that serves a noble goal won’t necessarily sell itself, even if it’s cheap. Prices go up due to marketing expenses and the choice of using **sustainable**, **high-quality materials** because what is the point of making something that is supposed to be good for someone’s health if you are trashing the planet in the mean time! This is why we spend a lot of time choosing the varnish we use and the location of our production.
But all this irreversibly means that our price ranges towards the higher end.

In the end it all comes down to this: **_good design leaves a positive impact_**.
That’s Jaswig’s goal.

But we still have a long way ahead…
