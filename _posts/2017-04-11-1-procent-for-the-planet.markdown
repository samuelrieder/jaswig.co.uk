We all have a responsibility towards the planet. As individuals but also as a business. This means Jaswig has a responsibility towards the planet and that is why we are part of 1 % of the planet!

## 1. Why

Jaswig is an entity that we can shape according to our beliefs and values. We should shape it in such a way that it is sustainable (in the broadest meaning of the word: financially, ecologically and socially). For the ecological sustainability we didn’t only want to invest in the best possible materials, factories and design. We wanted to do more, as we still have a large impact on the world even if we try to do things as good as possible. This is why we choose to be a part of 1% for the planet

## 2. What

[1% for the planet](http://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org/) is an organization that was cofounded by Yvon Chouinard the founder of the outdoor clothing company [Patagonia](http://eu.patagonia.com/). He is a vivid believer that you can use business to do good in the world. And for us Jaswig is just that. It is our creation with which we want to invest in a more sustainable future!

## 3. How does it work?

They tried to make it as easy as possible for everyone to understand. We have to give away at least 1% of our **annual SALES/REVENUE** to organization that are part of the 1% for the planet network. We will look for European initiatives that are in reforestation and land protection. This year we’ll give our funds to [Natuurpunt](http://natuurpunt.be) because it creates nature in Belgium where green is sometimes hard to find.
