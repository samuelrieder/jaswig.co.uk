Jessica Alba shows us why it is important to move or exercise at work but also which exercises you could do.

<!--more-->

## Evil desk chairs

Jessica explains very clearly what we have been trying to say for a while. Even exercising after you sat all day at work doesn't undo the harm that was done by sitting all day. The message really is simple: get out of your chair and start moving as much as you can while working.

## Different exercises

Next to the main message Jessica dives in straight to the solutions. First of all you'll notice that she is standing behind a standing desk converter. Next to that she'll show you some exercises that you can do while in the office. Ok, we admit you are rather "visible" but than again it makes you feel better and is just fun to do.

Enjoy!
