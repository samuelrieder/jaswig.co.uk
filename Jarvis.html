            At Jaswig it is all about beauty, health and sustainability. The Jarvis Bamboo is the perfect choice for both environmentally and aesthetically conscious standing desk users.<br><br>

            The desktop consists out of sustainable bamboo harvested without pesticides or fertilizers not from any chemical dyes or stains.<br><br>

            The desk’s frame is one of many reasons Jarvis has been named best standing desk by <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-standing-desk/">The Wirecutter</a> for four years in a row. It has an industry-leading lifting capacity of 158 kg, you can load up your desktop with just about anything you want. It is so versatile that the LED programmable handset lets you quickly adjust the desk low enough for a child to sit to high enough for a 2m tall person to stand—and every leaning, twisting, perching whim between.<br><br>

            Jarvis bamboo is available with a selection of accessories that have been fine-tuned and battle tested for maximum lovability.<br><br>

            We offer the Bamboo desktop on our webshop but have other make-to-order options available. Even reusing your current desktop and mounting it on the Jarvis frame is possible.<br><br>

            The Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk is part of Jaswig's portfolio because of our partnership with <a href="https://www.fully.com/">Fully</a>.<br><br>
