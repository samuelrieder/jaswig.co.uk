      <h2>Test the Jaswig Experience for Free</h2>
      <p>
        Designing furniture is one thing. But implenting it correctly is another. We want our StandUp to have an impact on the people and their environment. If the desks don't have the desired impact it is of no use to implement them.<br><br>

        Our TestCubes are designed to make you feel what the Jaswig Experience is all about. People can feel how they interact with the table and how they like to use it.

              The Jaswig TestCube created a flexible and beautiful place to strech our legs and work upright from time to time. People did all sorts of things at the desks. They were truly multifunctional!

              We conducted a survey from our staff during the test. It was so interesting to see how people had perceived this test. They really liked the product. They valued its flexibility and loved to use it from time to time.
